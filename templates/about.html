        <p>
            The <strong>Hotel Revenue Management System (RMS)</strong> is an easy-to-use platform that analyzes
            historical room-pricing data
            and produces accurate forecasts for future rates. It is built to support hotel owners, managers, and revenue
            analysts who need
            reliable pricing guidance without spending hours on manual analysis.

        <p>
            Upload your historical CSV file of room rates and booking information. RMS preprocesses the data, applies
            machine learning
            forecasting models, and returns predicted room rates for future dates. Results are available as a
            downloadable CSV or as JSON
            for integration with other systems.
